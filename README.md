# Standup
An automated way to keep track of standups in markdown files.

## Installation
From your terminal, clone the repository where you want it.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/evanthegrayt/standup.git
cd standup
rake # gem install rake
```

## Usage
Call the execuable.

```sh
standup
```

This does stuff.

## Overriding Settings
You can create a file called `~/.standups.yml`, and preferences set in this file
will override the defaults located in the [default config
file](config/preferences.yml).
